Ory Hydra &amp; Kratos Experiment

-----

**NOT COMPLETE**  
**This repo is a work in progress.  I've just started it.  As of right now, Hydra works.  Once I figure out Kratos I'll add that as well.**

## Background  

Long story short, the Ory documentation sucks.  This repo was started to help me wrap my head around their product and, in the process, hopefully help others who may just be starting out with Hyra and Kratos.  I am not an expert in either of these technologies.

## What is Koramo.Com?

The domain `koramo.com` is a garbage name of random letters I created years ago for testing purposes.  You'll see it used throughout this repo.  It's easy to pronouce and understand when teaching, so I keep it around for purposes like this.  Obviously, this domain will never work outside of my little testing environment.
